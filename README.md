"By 2022, 70% of organizations that attempt to adopt microservices will have found the effort too
disruptive and will have switched to miniservices instead."

This quote is particularly important because it dispels the "hype" surrounding microservices, and puts into perspective how challenging microservices can be to implement. The efficacy of microservices has been proven by successful digital businesses such as Netflix, Amazon, and Twitter, but it is also important the businesss leaders understand the risks of microservices so that their investments in microservices are succesful. The Gartner report lists a few specific costs that could catch many organizations off-guard:

 - Microservices require substantial technical and cultural changes
 - "solid competency in agile and DevOps practices"
 - Microservices change how data is managed, because each microservice cannot share its data
 - Microservices need to be developed with a product mindset: a focus on producing value for the customer
 - Teams need to have significant autonomy in order to build an effective microservice
 - Microservices require a complex application infrastructure for developing and deploying microservices
 
Gartner does offer an alternative to microservices for companies that do not have the prerequisites for building microservices: the similarly named and frequently confused "miniservices". The miniservice is similar to a microservice, except it has more relaxed architectural constraints that allow a team to build within the constraints of their current organization, rather than disrupt the organization as is required for microservices. Specifically, while a microservice has to adhere to a strict set of guidelines (described in the Gartner report) in order to enable delivery, microservices give the organization the freedom to improve their agility with an architectural paradigm similar to microservices without enforcing the potentially destructive microservice requirements.

Being aware of the costs of microservices and the possibility of using a miniservice is what I consider the most useful takeaway from this paper. It gives you the ability to evaluate your organizations ability to adopt microservices vs. miniservices and select the most beneficial option. Microservices are more costly than miniservices, but microservices enables continuous delivery.
